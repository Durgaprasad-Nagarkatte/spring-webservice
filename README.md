Trying to build a simple social media application

User -> Posts

- Retrieve all Users - GET /users
- Create a User - POST /users
- Retrieve one User - GET /users/{id}
- Delete a User - DELETE /users/{id}

- Retrieve all posts for a User -> GET /users/{id}/posts
- Create a post for a User -> POST /users/{id}/posts
- Retrieve details of a post -> GET /users/{id}/posts/{post_id}
